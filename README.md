# Location directory

This project is a tech demo for a location based directory.  I hope to develop it into a usable boilerplate that can be easily set up.

_This project is a work in progress_

### Please Note:
* Search results are randomly generated (from DataSourceDummy) and will change each time, ocassionally returning no results to mimick there being no relevant results in the search vicinity.
* The links from the nav menu do not have active pages and will 404.

## Techonolgies + Methodologies used:

* React
* Webpack 2
* SCSS, complying to OOCSS
* HTML & CSS3 (flexbox, responsive breakpoints)
* Google places API.

## Todo list:
* Create a Listing Page route for page details
* Migrate CSS to emotionjs
* (or SCSS autoprefixer [https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer] )
* Improve documentation of classes, methods etc
* Tighten up the spec of the ListingData service to refine returned object.
* Make it pretty
* Write component tests
* Search for `Tidyup` for pieces of code I think I could write more efficiently.
